# Not My Tempo 🥁
For those looking to play with a drum set!<br>
This is a simple drumming game inspired by the movie "Whiplash" directed by Damien Chazelle <br>
Players are able to set a tempo for others to try... if they get it right, perhaps they will be invited to the band :) <br>

👉 Try it [here](https://notmytempo.vercel.app)!<br>

## Future Directions 
- Implement a hint functionality that allows players to listen to the set pattern
- Create a set pattern for anybody to guess, change weekly, for single players out there
